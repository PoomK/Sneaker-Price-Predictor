In this video, I am extracting the sneaker name of the first sneaker on the stockx website, printing it and splitting the words to store into an array.

<h2>Scraping first 5 sneaker names and storing them into special name arrays in a csv file</h2>
In this video, I am getting the names of the first five sneakers, converting them into special name arrays, and storing them into csv file. (The gif only supports 5fps as the video is quite long so bare with the laggy style)
